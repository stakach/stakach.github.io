This is an overview on how I configured and programmed a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-zero-2-w/) to control the [Ladies First Chicken Door](https://www.ladiesfirstchickendoor.com/)

The door is designed to allow the chickens out in the yard either on a schedule or triggered remotely via a web application, [home automation app control](https://github.com/spider-gazelle/matter) is coming soon.

This allows us to lock down the chickens to their large secure run when predators such as foxes have been detected on our yard cameras.
